# c3-boot-proofs

c3-boot-proofs holds the Lean proofs for c3-boot, the verified OTA
bootloader that [`docs/esp32c3-verified-ota-plan.md`](../docs/esp32c3-verified-ota-plan.md)
describes. This first part needs no machine model: it specifies the
bootloader's decision logic in Lean and proves the plan's boot-safety
theorems about it, over traces with power loss.

## What's proved

`C3BootProofs/Spec/` is the executable specification. Each definition
follows the Rust code it names:

- `Level.lean`: the security level, eFuse burns, the bit-by-bit raise, the
  burn target, and the level rules (`c3_verify::level`,
  `efuse::raise_level`).
- `BootState.lean`: the boot-state record's transitions and the trial plan
  (`c3_verify::bootstate`).
- `Boot.lean`: `decideBoot`, the boot decision (`c3_verify::boot::decide`).

`C3BootProofs/Theorems/Trace.lean` models a device as its eFuse field, its
boot-state record, and the result of checking each slot. A trace mixes
arbitrary flash and record writes by an attacker, boots that lose power and
burn arbitrary eFuse bits, and boots that run to the jump. Over every such
trace, it proves the following:

| Theorem | Statement |
| --- | --- |
| `efuse_monotone` | No step lowers the security level |
| `rollback` | If a step ends with the level at L, every jump in that step or a later one goes to a slot whose level is at least L |
| `boots_safe` | Every jump goes to a slot accepted at the level the bootloader read, after the level reached that slot's burn target |
| `availability` | When some slot is accepted, a boot can run to a jump |

A boot that halts, including the bootloader's halt when an eFuse bit fails
to program, is an `interrupted` step, which may leave any bits and any
record. So `availability` assumes the eFuses program and the boot isn't cut
short; the other theorems hold either way. Where the Rust code writes the
record relative to the slot checks is outside this model, because an
interrupted boot may leave any record. `c3-verify`'s `boot::tests` pin that
order.

`C3BootProofs/Audit.lean` pins each theorem's axioms (`propext` and
`Quot.sound`) and proves that admissible traces with a jump exist.

These theorems cover the decision logic only. The slot checks
(signatures, the key-set chain, and the Sigstore bundle) are abstracted as
the `slots` function, which an attacker's flash writes may set to anything,
so nothing here shows that an accepted slot is authentic. That, and
connecting these theorems to the RISC-V binary, is the plan's machine-code
and cryptography work.

## Differential test

`lake exe spec-vectors` prints the specification's answers for 171,235
inputs: every `SECURE_VERSION` value, every level-rule input, every burn
target, and the boot decision for 216 records, 4 eFuse levels, and 25 pairs
of slot results. `c3-boot/verify/examples/spec_vectors.rs` prints the Rust
code's answers in the same format, and CI requires the two to be identical.

## Build and test

Install [elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan), then run:

```bash
cd c3-boot-proofs
lake build
lake exe spec-vectors > /tmp/lean.txt
(cd ../c3-boot && cargo run --release -q -p c3-verify --example spec_vectors) > /tmp/rust.txt
diff /tmp/lean.txt /tmp/rust.txt
```

`lean-toolchain` pins Lean 4.34.0, the version that
[`google-deepmind/code-verification`](https://github.com/google-deepmind/code-verification)
uses. The project has no dependencies.
