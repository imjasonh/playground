# Future Work

This is the consolidated TODO for pasta. It pulls items from
[cue.md](./cue.md) (the CUE-leverage essay) that we haven't yet
implemented, plus gaps that surfaced while writing analyzers.

Each item has a short description, a rough effort estimate (S / M / L),
and a brief note on context where useful.

The framework today is plenty for many analyzers — 35 ship today across
7 languages, with fact-passing, fixpoint scheduling, and node-indexed
matching. Most of the items below are about reducing boilerplate,
catching errors earlier, or unlocking cross-file analysis.

## DSL extensions

### `*` and `+` quantifiers in `adjacent`
**Effort:** M.
We currently have no adjacent quantifiers — even `?` was removed in
favor of splitting into separate rules. Bringing them back (`*` for
zero-or-more, `+` for one-or-more) would be useful for "any number of
leading defer statements" or "three or more consecutive slice
appends", but only when those shapes actually need to be matched
inside one rule rather than via fact-passing.

### Type-aware predicates
**Effort:** L. **Surfaced by:** rust_to_string_when_already_string,
go_unused_assignment, ts_redundant_assertion, java_string_pool_compare,
js_var_to_let (TDZ-safety check).
Most "is this rewrite safe" rules need type information pasta doesn't
have. Examples: `is x a String or a &str?` (Rust), `is this expression
nullable?` (TypeScript), `does this `var` introduce a TDZ
incompatibility?` (JavaScript). Wiring this up means either bringing
back per-language adapters with real type checkers (Go's `go/types`,
TS compiler, etc.) or shelling out to language servers. CUE side
would expose `type_is`, `is_nullable`, `same_object` (resolve to the
same declaration, not just same text — closes a known soundness gap
in `same_ident`), and similar predicates.

### `all_match` meta-predicate
**Effort:** M.
Invokes a sub-predicate on every named child of a captured list:
`{op: "all_match", args: [@list, "matches", "regex"]}`. Lets a rule
say "every LHS expression is an identifier" without a custom check.
DSL change: `Predicate.args` would need to allow nested predicate
specs.

### File-extension / filename gating per rule
**Status:** Done. Rules accept `file_match: [...string]`
(`path/filepath.Match` globs on the basename). See
`testdata/file_match/` and `AGENTS.md`.

### Sibling-absence predicates
**Effort:** S. **Surfaced by:** dockerfile_no_user (no `USER`
directive in the file), bash_use_set_e (script body lacks `set -e`
near top), python_missing_dunder_init (class lacks `__init__`).
`absent_fields` covers field-level absence; nothing covers
"this stmt list lacks a child of type X". A predicate like
`{op: "no_child_of_type", args: [@cap, "type"]}` (or
`{op: "subtree_lacks", args: [@cap, "type"]}`) would close it.

### Conditional / branching rewrites (`yaml_truthy` shape)
**Effort:** M. **Surfaced by:** yaml_truthy (would be a single rule if
edits could branch on captured text), regex-canonicalizer rules,
case-normalization rules.
Today the rewrite shape is fixed at rule definition. A `cases:` edit
form — pattern→replacement table evaluated at rewrite time — would
let one rule say "if @x matches /yes|on/i emit `true`, else emit
`false`". Less composable than two rules with disjoint matchers, but
much more expressive for normalize-to-canonical-form patterns.

### Sub-extraction from string captures
**Effort:** L. **Surfaced by:** python_string_format_to_fstring
(needs to pull `{}` placeholders out of a format-string capture),
printf-style rewrites in any language.
Captures are opaque text from pasta's perspective. Pulling structured
content out of a string-literal capture (a list of `%s`/`%d` tokens,
the inside of a `{...}`, etc.) would unlock a class of refactor rules
that today need per-language Go code.

### Indentation-aware rewrites (whitespace-sensitive languages)
**Effort:** M. **Surfaced by:** python_redundant_else_after_return
(can't auto-fix because the else-block needs dedenting).
For Python and other indentation-significant languages, byte-range
edits aren't enough — the matcher needs to understand the captured
node's indent level and emit the rewrite at the right level. A
helper that computes "how indented is @cap relative to its enclosing
block" plus an interpolation-time `dedent` operation would cover the
common cases.

### Auto-import on rewrites
**Effort:** M. **Surfaced by:** any rule that introduces a name
from a different package or module than the original.
If a rewrite uses `errors.As` and the file doesn't already import
`errors`, the import block needs an entry added. No edit form
expresses "ensure `import "x"` exists at the top of the file". A
declarative `requires_import: ["errors"]` field on `#Rewrite`, with
language-specific import-block walkers, would handle most cases.

### `subtree_has_type` / `subtree_lacks_type`
**Effort:** S. **Surfaced by:** rust_unsafe_no_safety attempt.
A predicate `{op: "subtree_has", args: [@cap, "type"]}` that reports
whether a captured node's subtree contains any descendant of the
given type. Useful for "does this function body contain a `panic!()`".
We have helpers (`subtreeReferences`) — exposing them as a predicate is
straightforward.

### `subtree_has_type` / `subtree_lacks_type`
**Effort:** S. **Surfaced by:** rust_unsafe_no_safety attempt.
A predicate `{op: "subtree_has", args: [@cap, "type"]}` that reports
whether a captured node's subtree contains any descendant of the
given type. Useful for "does this function body contain a `panic!()`".
We have helpers (`subtreeReferences`) — exposing them as a predicate is
straightforward.

### Slicing on `@capture` interpolation
**Effort:** S. **Surfaced by:** dbg-macro rewrite.
Today we have edit-level `trim_start` / `trim_end`. A more general
interpolation form `@cap[N:M]` would let any text reference a substring
of a capture. Mostly cosmetic; `trim_start`/`trim_end` already covers
the common case.

### N-arg variadic rewrites
**Effort:** M. **Surfaced by:** Object.assign / [].concat rules.
`{...x, ...y, ...z}` from `Object.assign({}, x, y, z)` requires the
rewrite to know the number of arguments at runtime. The current
`replacement: "{...@x, ...@y}"` syntax is fixed. Options: (a) loop
construct in interpolation; (b) per-arity rules; (c) a "join captures"
edit form.

### Quantifier on `preceding`
**Effort:** S. **Surfaced by:** rust_unsafe_no_safety attempt.
`preceding` already accepts `quantifier: "?"`. Combined with a
`prev_sibling_does_not_match` predicate, this could express
"unsafe block without preceding SAFETY comment" cleanly. Today the
match would be: preceding optional + WHERE NOT preceded by safety
comment — needs negative matching (which we do have via
`prev_sibling_matches` + `not_matches`).

---

## CUE leverage (cue.md)

### Pattern libraries (cue.md §1.2)
**Effort:** L (worth it).
Build out `github.com/imjasonh/pasta/patterns/<lang>/` — importable CUE
definitions for common shapes:

```cue
// github.com/imjasonh/pasta/patterns/go
#NilComparison: schema.#Pattern & {...}
#ShortVarDecl:  schema.#Pattern & {...}
#ErrorReturningFunc: schema.#Pattern & {...}
#StmtList:      schema.#Pattern & {...}
```

Today every rule re-specifies these from scratch. iferr, errcheck,
taint, deprecated_use, and several others have hand-rolled patterns
for "function declaration with name capture" or "assignment from
identifier to identifier". Extracting them shrinks rule files
substantially and makes new rules easier to author. Highest ROI item
in this list.

### Predicate-arg-shape validation
**Effort:** S.
The schema enumerates `#Predicate.op` and (now) `#Precondition.check`
as closed sets, and the loader walks captures to catch typos. The
remaining gap is per-op arg shape — e.g. `ancestor_is` requires
args[1] to be a list of strings; `matches` requires args[1] to be a
valid Go regex; `nil_comparison` needs exactly three capture refs.
The current validator's `predicateCaptureArgs` table half-encodes
this; promoting it to a fuller per-op contract would catch more
authoring mistakes at load time.

### Rule inheritance refactor (cue.md §2.3)
**Effort:** S.
Refactor iferr's two rules (`inline_define` and `inline_assign`) to
extend a shared `#IferrBase` definition with the common shape (node
union, diagnose message, rewrite opts). Demonstrates CUE unification.

### Conditional-field language polymorphism (cue.md §4)
**Effort:** M.
Write ONE `#TaintAnalyzer` definition that, given a `_lang` parameter,
generates the language-specific source/sink/assignment patterns:

```cue
#TaintAnalyzer: {
    _lang: "go" | "python" | "rust" | "javascript"
    rules: {
        if _lang == "go" { ... go-specific match shapes ... }
        if _lang == "python" { ... python ... }
        ...
    }
}
```

Today we have four near-identical taint analyzers (go_taint,
python_taint, rust_taint, js_taint). Conditional fields would let one
definition produce all four.

### Lattice-model facts (cue.md §5)
**Effort:** L.
Speculative. Facts as CUE values that unify monotonically rather than
overwriting. Convergence detection becomes "did the CUE value change?"
Worth prototyping when sophisticated dataflow analyses arrive.

### Auto-generated diagnostic metadata (cue.md §3)
**Effort:** S.
Derive a `_help_url` from each rule's name, inject into every
diagnostic. Add a `severity` default tied to rule category. Pure
CUE — no runtime change.

---

## Fact system

### Cross-file / cross-package facts
**Status: implemented (basic form).**
`engine.RunGroup` parses every file in a group with a single shared
fact store. Topological scheduling runs each rule across every file
applicable to its language for a given topo level; fixpoint groups
loop emit-only across all files until the store converges, then do
one collection pass. The factstore's by-range index includes the
file-id (so two files with overlapping byte ranges don't collide);
the by-name index is intentionally file-agnostic so an
`identifier`-anchored fact emitted in one file is visible at query
sites in another. `runner.TestDir` treats each subdirectory of
`testdata/` as a multi-file analysis group; top-level files remain
independent. See `analyzers/go_unused_export/` for a worked example
and `analyzers/go_deprecated_use/testdata/cross_file/` for a
cross-file regression of an existing single-file analyzer.

What's still missing:
- **Package-aware grouping.** Today every file in a `testdata/`
  subdir (or every file passed to the CLI) is one group. There's
  no notion of "go.mod / package imports define the group" — a
  CUE-declared convention or per-language packager would close
  that.
- **Cross-language coordination beyond by-name.** Cross-language
  facts work by string matching on the identifier text; for
  precision (e.g. `errors` is a Go package, also a Python module
  name) you'd want a typed fact namespace. See "Cross-analyzer
  fact namespacing" below.

### Scope-aware fact keys
**Effort:** M. **Surfaced by:** taint analyzers' caveat.
Today the fact store has a secondary by-name index that's
scope-blind: a name shadowed in another function still hits a fact
keyed by that name. The taint testdata works around this by using
unique variable names per function. Real precision needs facts keyed
by `(name, scope-id)` where scope-id is derived from the enclosing
function or block.

### Cross-analyzer fact namespacing
**Effort:** S.
Today fact `kinds` are flat strings across all loaded analyzers. Two
analyzers using `kind: "tainted"` for different purposes would
collide. A scoped form like `analyzerName.kind` would prevent it. Low
priority until two analyzers actually conflict.

### Fact `scope` field
**Effort:** M.
`#Fact` could grow a `scope: "node" | "file" | "package" | "module"`
field that controls how the runtime keys the fact. Most facts today
are implicitly node-scoped (with the by-name secondary index acting
as a poor file-scope). Explicit scope makes the storage strategy
declarative and ties into cross-file work.

## Rewrite escape hatches

The current edit primitives (`target`/`replacement`,
`position`/`anchor`, `delete_from`/`delete_to`, `within`,
`trim_start`/`trim_end`) cover most syntactic rewrites. They struggle
when the new code can't be assembled by stitching captures and
literals — e.g. generating import statements, computing
correctly-quoted JSON for a captured value, or producing different
text per call site.

Options worth exploring (none yet implemented):

1. **CUE expressions in replacement text.** `replacement: "if \(strings.ToUpper(@name)) ..."`.
   Constrains computation to what CUE can express, which is
   surprisingly powerful (string ops, comprehensions).

2. **Starlark snippets per rewrite.** Bigger surface area, escapes
   the CUE-only invariant. Significant scope and complicates
   security/sandboxing.

3. **Transform functions registered in Go.** Rules reference a
   transform by name; Go-side registry computes the new text. Lowest
   effort, breaks the "rules are pure CUE" promise. Useful escape
   hatch for rare cases (one or two transforms instead of a generic
   mechanism).

Pick when a real use case forces the choice.

## Performance

The streaming engine, persistent parse cache, and `max_file_size`
cap shipped together (PR #7). Follow-ups that have also landed:

- **CLI stream read-per-worker** — `cmd/pasta` no longer slurps every
  source into a giant `[]FileSpec` before scheduling; workers read
  paths on demand.
- **Per-file parse budget** — default 2s (`-parse-timeout` /
  `parse_timeout_ms`); timed-out files are reported as
  "too complex to analyze" and skipped.
- **Content-sniff pre-filter** and **arena pool drain** — see below.

The remaining ceiling on cold-cache runs is still the parser itself.

### Switch to cgo tree-sitter
**Status:** Superseded by WASM. pasta now embeds the official C
tree-sitter runtime + grammars as `internal/tswasm/ts-core.wasm.br`
and drives them via wazero (`CGO_ENABLED=0`, `go install` still
works). Native cgo would still be ~2× faster than WASM on raw parse
(see dvcdsys/code-index PR #81) but is not worth the toolchain
breakage unless a profile shows parse dominating end-to-end again.

### Parallel warm-cache reads
**Effort:** S.
The streaming worker pool already runs N goroutines, and on a warm
run each worker's only work is `HashFile` + `Cache.Get` (open + gob
decode + chtimes). Top reports ~100% CPU on big warm runs because
disk I/O for the cache reads serialises through the kernel.
Reading the cache entries with `bufio.Reader` plus a smaller
on-disk format (see below) should let warm runs spread across
cores. Current absolute numbers are tiny (70 ms on the full kubectl
module), so this is polish, not a load-bearing item.

### Content-sniff pre-filter
**Status:** Done. `internal/prefilter` infers substrings from
`eq`/`token_eq` and at most one simple `matches` alternation, and
honours explicit `require_substring` on `#Rule`. Rewrite `within`
tokens are intentionally not inferred (diagnose can fire without
them). The streaming and in-memory engine paths skip the parse when
no applicable rule can match.

### Tighter cache encoding than `gob`
**Effort:** S.
Each cache entry today is ~500 bytes of gob — most of which is
type metadata, not data. A hand-rolled binary encoding (or
encoding/json with `omitempty`) would shrink entries 3–5× and
decode faster. Matters once cache size limits start biting on
huge monorepos; on kubectl the whole cache is 250 KB and nobody
will notice.

### Async / batched cache writes
**Effort:** S.
`Cache.Put` is on the worker goroutine's hot path: gob encode +
CreateTemp + Encode + Rename per file. Pushing writes to a
single background goroutine via a channel would let the worker
return to parsing the next file immediately. Modest wall-time
gain on cold runs (a few percent), zero impact on warm runs.

### Drain arena pools between batches
**Status:** Done. The streaming path calls `tsutil.DrainArenaPools()`
every 100 completed files (and once at the end of the run). The
in-memory path drains on exit.

### Early termination per rule
**Effort:** S.
For rules that only `Diagnose` (no `Emit`, no `Rewrite`), once a
match has been recorded the matcher could short-circuit further
exploration of the same anchor's subtree. Minor speedup; relevant
mostly for rules that match deeply-nested anchors.

### Index incremental update during fixpoint
**Effort:** S.
The node-type index is built once per parse. During fixpoint
iteration, the underlying tree doesn't change, so the index stays
valid. If we ever support incremental edits during a Run, the index
would need to update.

---

## Tooling / UX

A few of these (the LSP server, project config, per-rule
suppression directives, filename gating) have already shipped — the
remaining items below are the gaps still on the usability roadmap,
roughly ordered by adoption impact.

### `pasta init` / `pasta new <lang>_<name>` to scaffold rules
**Effort:** S.
`pasta init` creates `.pasta/` with a starter rule + `testdata/`,
mirroring `analyzers/<name>/`. `pasta new` adds a rule inside an
existing dir from a small recipe set (rewrite vs. diagnostic-only,
fact-passing) so a contributor starts from a known-good shape.
Lowers the barrier to first analyzer; today new authors copy from
the repo and learn the layout by hand.

### `pasta test --watch` / `--update`
**Effort:** S.
The `// want` / golden loop is the tightest authoring feedback we
have; auto-rerun on file change (watch) plus regenerate-golden-on-
demand (update) would make it tighter. `runner.TestDir` already
returns structured failures, so this is glue.

### Better diagnostic output
**Effort:** S.
Today the CLI prints `path:line: message [rule]`. Adding column
ranges (we have byte ranges in Diagnostic.StartByte/EndByte) and
optionally a snippet of the offending source would match what
modern linters output. A `-format=text|json|sarif|github` flag
would unlock GitHub code-scanning, GitLab, and IDE integrations
that already speak SARIF; the `github` actions-format gives inline
PR annotations for free.

### Severity-aware exit codes and end-of-run summary
**Effort:** S.
Adding `-W error` (treat warnings as errors) / `--max-warnings N`
plus a final-line summary like `3 errors, 12 warnings, 5 fixable`
matches what `eslint` / `clippy` / `golangci-lint` users expect.
Config-level severity overrides are already wired up (`config.cue`
`severity:`), so the policy half is done.

### `pasta explain <rule>` and auto-derived help URLs
**Effort:** S. **Surfaced by:** every diagnostic users see.
The Diagnose schema already carries `message`; what's missing is a
help URL and a way to print the full rule docstring without grep.
Synthesizing `_help_url` from the rule name (mirrors clippy's
approach) plus a `pasta explain` subcommand that prints `rule.Doc`,
severity, fixability, and the help URL would cover both ends. Pure
CUE / runner work, no engine change.

### `pasta doctor`
**Effort:** S.
Diagnose common setup issues in one shot: pre-commit hook
installed, rules dir found, lockfile in sync, all referenced
grammars linked, `config.cue` parses cleanly. Cuts down on
"why isn't it working" support — a lot of failures today surface as
unrelated CUE errors rather than a clear "your hook isn't
installed" message.

### Distribution
**Effort:** S–M.
Adoption ceiling is low until installation is one line:
- Prebuilt binaries via goreleaser per tagged release.
- Homebrew tap.
- `imjasonh/pasta-action@v1` GitHub Action wrapping `pasta` /
  `pasta -fix` with optional SARIF upload.
- Static rule-registry page generated from analyzer metadata —
  every shipped rule + any blessed remote modules — so users can
  browse without cloning.

### `pasta lint` over a project (vs. `pasta -fix` per file)
**Effort:** M.
A subcommand that walks the working tree, detects languages by
extension, runs every shipped analyzer applicable to each file, and
reports. Mostly subsumed by the `-format` flag above; this entry is
the heavier workflow framing for CI integrations that want a single
canonical entry point.

### `pasta:ignore-next-line` form
**Effort:** S.
The current per-line directive (`// pasta:ignore <rule>`) anchors
on the same line as the diagnostic. A
`// pasta:ignore-next-line` variant would suppress findings on
lines that can't carry a trailing comment — Python decorators,
expression-continuation lines, the line being rewritten. One-screen
addition to `internal/engine/suppress.go`.

### Severity overrides via CLI flag
**Effort:** S.
`config.cue` lets a project pin per-rule severity; a
`-severity rule=error,other=info` flag would let CI override
locally without committing config changes. Plumbs into the same
applyConfig path the loader already uses.

### Comment preservation polish
**Effort:** S. **Surfaced by:** iferr edge cases.
The current preserveComments logic floats comments in the deleted
range to before the inserted text. Edge cases (multi-line block
comments at unusual indents, comments spanning the deletion boundary)
are tested via iferr's testdata but the implementation could be
clearer about its assumptions.

---

## Speculative

### Lattice-model facts (cue.md §5)
See above under CUE leverage. Worth a prototype when an analysis
needs it.

### Tree-sitter queries as a backend
The pattern matcher is hand-written. Tree-sitter ships its own query
language with field constraints, predicates, and capture quantifiers.
Compiling pasta patterns to TS queries could eliminate a chunk of
matcher code, at the cost of being constrained to what TS queries
can express. Worth investigating if the matcher grows much more.
