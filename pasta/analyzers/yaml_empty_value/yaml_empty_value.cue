// yaml_empty_value flags a key with no value (e.g. `key:` followed by
// end-of-line and the next key, not by a nested mapping). YAML
// interprets this as `null`, which is rarely what the author intended;
// they typically meant either an empty string `""` or to delete the
// key. Common source of bugs in CI pipelines and Helm charts.
//
// No auto-fix: we don't know whether the intent was `""`, `null`
// explicit, or to delete the key.
