// js_object_assign_spread rewrites `Object.assign({}, src)` to the
// spread form `{...src}`. The spread form is shorter, doesn't allocate
// an intermediate empty object as the target, and is more readable.
// Limited here to the single-source two-arg form because the rewrite
// for N sources would need an N-way join (`{...a, ...b, ...c}`) which
// the current CUE rewrite syntax can't easily express.
