// python_taint is a three-rule taint tracker for Python that
// demonstrates fixpoint scheduling: the `propagate` rule both
// consumes and produces the `tainted` fact, so the engine groups it
// into a fixpoint SCC and re-runs it until the fact store stops
// growing.
//
// Sources, sinks, and propagation are all by IDENTIFIER NAME (the
// fact store's secondary by-name index). This makes the analysis
// scope-agnostic — the same name reused in different scopes is treated
// as a single tainted variable. Scope-aware fact keys are tracked in
// future-work.md.
//
// Pass 1 — mark_sources: `x = input()` tags `x` as tainted.
// Pass 2 — propagate: `y = x` where `x` is tainted, tag `y`. SELF-LOOP.
// Pass 3 — check_sinks: `eval(z)` etc. where `z` is tainted, warn.
