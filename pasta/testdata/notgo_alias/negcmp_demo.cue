// negcmp_demo is a small rule packaged alongside the notgo language
// declaration in this directory. It rewrites `!(a == b)` to `a != b`,
// targeting any language whose tree-sitter grammar is "go".
//
// Because .notgo files (declared in notgo.cue) use the Go grammar, this
// rule fires on them automatically — no rule change required to support
// the new extension. The same rule would also fire on .go files; the
// runner restricts its run to whatever extensions the input file has.
