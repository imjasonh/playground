# git-k8s

git-k8s runs a branch workflow on Kubernetes. It tracks a remote git
repository's branches as `GitBranch` objects and runs checks on branches
that propose changes to another branch. Checks can push commits that fix
what they find. When the parent's merge policy passes, git-k8s fast-forwards
the parent to the branch.

It's a rewrite of [imjasonh/git-k8s](https://github.com/imjasonh/git-k8s)
on [`kube`](../kube/), the controller framework in this repository. The
module imports `kube` at head with `replace github.com/imjasonh/playground/kube => ../kube`.

## How it works

You write a `GitRepository`:

```yaml
apiVersion: git-k8s.imjasonh.com/v1alpha1
kind: GitRepository
metadata:
  name: app
spec:
  url: https://git.example.com/app.git
  secretRef:
    name: app-creds         # username and password keys, for HTTP basic auth
  pollInterval: 30s
  branches:
    - match: main
      merge:
        checks:
          - name: base
            mayPush: true
          - name: gofmt
            mayPush: true
          - name: risk
          - name: approval
        when: >-
          checks.base.passed && checks.gofmt.passed &&
          (checks.risk.outputs.level == "low" || checks.approval.passed)
        deleteMergedBranches: true
    - match: c/**
      parent: main
```

For each remote branch, the first rule whose `match` glob matches applies,
and branches that match no rule aren't tracked. A branch whose rule names a
`parent` is a proposal to that parent. The parent's rule says what a proposal
needs before it lands.

`url` must be an `https://`, `http://`, `git://`, or `ssh://` URL, or an
scp-like address with a user name, such as `git@example.com:app.git`. Without
a user name, write an `ssh://` URL, such as `ssh://example.com/~/app.git`. The
API server rejects other URLs, and git-k8s runs git with `GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL`
set to those transports. Its git commands put `--end-of-options` before every
URL, branch, and commit, so git can't read one as an option. git-k8s doesn't
track branches whose names start with `-` or aren't valid ref names.

Put credentials in `secretRef`, not in `url`. `kubectl get gitrepositories`
shows each URL, and `check-gotest` copies it into its Pod specs.

The `git-k8s` program runs two controllers, and each check runs as its own
program. Each controller is a `kube.For` reconciler:

- The **repositories** controller lists each repository's branches with
  `git ls-remote` and declares a `GitBranch` for each tracked branch with
  `kube.Own`. The spec holds the branch's head, its parent's head, and the
  parent's merge policy. When a branch disappears from the remote, kube
  deletes its `GitBranch`, because the reconcile stops declaring it. A remote
  can't be watched, so the controller asks to run again after `pollInterval`.
- Each **check** controller is its own program. It reconciles `GitBranch`
  objects through a view type that declares only the check's own entry in
  `status.checks`. kube writes the view's status with server-side apply, so
  each check manages one map key and never sees or rewrites another check's
  result. Results record the commits they're for, and the merge controller
  ignores results for older commits.
- The **merge** controller evaluates the merge policy's `when` expression
  over the fresh results. When it passes, the controller fast-forwards the
  parent with `git push --force-with-lease`, so a parent that moved in the
  meantime is never overwritten. It then deletes the branch if the policy
  says to.

The checks and the merge controller read each branch's repository as a
`gitk8s.Repository`, a `GitRepository` without its status, so the
repositories controller's status writes don't run them again.

Git objects stay in local bare repositories, one for each `GitRepository`
in each program. Only commit SHAs go into Kubernetes objects. Apart from
[events](#events), which the API server deletes after an hour by default, no
object records a single push or check run, so the API server holds a bounded
amount of state.

After a branch lands, `kubectl get gitbranches` shows what's still open:

```
NAME                    BRANCH   HEAD                                       PARENT   STATE              AGE
app-c-auth-f684729ccf   c/auth   d28547a6c959905ea8dc037ac37541167a50638c   main     WaitingForChecks   9s
app-main-9157892a7c     main     610a7734a0b4d1bc1991a669d9feb35fd159219b                               48s
```

The `Merged` condition's message explains a `WaitingForChecks` state, for
example `checks: approval Failed, base Passed, gofmt Passed, risk Passed (high)`.

## Events

The controllers record an event about a `GitBranch` each time they change
the remote:

| Reason | From | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PushedFix` | `check-NAME` | A check pushed a fix commit to the branch. |
| `Landed` | `merge` | The merge controller fast-forwarded the parent to the branch. |
| `DeletedBranch` | `merge` | The merge controller deleted the branch after it landed. |

`kubectl describe gitbranch GITBRANCH` lists a branch's events. After the
merge controller deletes a branch, the repositories controller deletes its
`GitBranch`, so list the namespace's events instead:

```sh
kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
```

After `c/fmt` in the end-to-end test lands, the output looks like this:

```
LAST SEEN   TYPE     REASON          OBJECT                           MESSAGE
14s         Normal   PushedFix       gitbranch/app-c-fmt-793d86522b   pushed 5d0c2e9a71b4 to c/fmt: 1 of 2 Go files need gofmt: util/add.go
9s          Normal   Landed          gitbranch/app-c-fmt-793d86522b   fast-forwarded main from 0e4f8a2c9d13 to c/fmt at 5d0c2e9a71b4
9s          Normal   DeletedBranch   gitbranch/app-c-fmt-793d86522b   deleted c/fmt at 5d0c2e9a71b4 after it landed on main
```

kube drops events when it falls behind on writing them, and the API server
deletes events after an hour by default. To audit what landed, use the
remote's history. `generate` grants `create` and `patch` on events to the
`git-k8s` program and to every check program. A check that never pushes a
fix, such as `check-approval`, gets the grant too, because the `checks`
package that every check uses records `PushedFix`.

## Checks

| Program | Check | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `check-base` | `base` | Passes when the branch contains its parent's head, or the parent already contains the branch. Otherwise it merges the parent in with `git merge-tree`, and fails with the conflicting paths if the merge conflicts. |
| `check-gofmt` | `gofmt` | Formats every `.go` file outside `vendor` and `testdata` directories with `go/format`, and passes when nothing changes. |
| `check-risk` | `risk` | Always passes, and sets `outputs.level` to `high` when the change is larger than `-max-lines` or touches a path that matches a `-sensitive` glob, and to `low` otherwise. |
| `check-approval` | `approval` | Passes when the `git-k8s.imjasonh.com/approve` annotation on the `GitBranch` names the branch's head. A push after the approval needs a new one. |
| `check-gotest` | `gotest` | Runs `go test ./...` in a Pod that it declares with `kube.Own`, and fails with the end of the test output. See [Sandboxed checks](#sandboxed-checks). |

A check with `mayPush: true` pushes its fix commit to the branch, which moves
the head and runs the checks again. Fix commits have a `Git-K8s-Fixer:
CHECK` trailer, and `maxAutomatedCommits` (default 5) limits how many a
branch can have, so two checks that undo each other's fixes stop. The same
inputs always produce the same fix commit, so two retries of one fix push the
same commit.

To approve a branch:

```sh
kubectl annotate gitbranch GITBRANCH git-k8s.imjasonh.com/approve=SHA
```

### Write a check

A check is a `checks.Check` and a view type that names its key in
`status.checks`. This `main` package, next to the others in `cmd/`, is a
complete check that fails branches without a `README.md`:

```go
type Branch struct {
	kube.Object `kube:"apiVersion=git-k8s.imjasonh.com/v1alpha1,kind=GitBranch,plural=gitbranches,scope=Namespaced"`
	Spec        gitk8s.GitBranchSpec `json:"spec"`
	Status      struct {
		Checks struct {
			Result *gitk8s.CheckResult `json:"readme,omitempty"`
		} `json:"checks,omitzero"`
	} `json:"status,omitzero"`
}

func (b *Branch) Parts() (*kube.ObjectMeta, *gitk8s.GitBranchSpec, **gitk8s.CheckResult) {
	return &b.ObjectMeta, &b.Spec, &b.Status.Checks.Result
}

func run(ctx context.Context, in *checks.Input) (checks.Verdict, error) {
	repo, err := in.Repo(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		return checks.Verdict{}, err
	}
	files, err := repo.LsTree(ctx, in.Spec.Head)
	if err != nil {
		return checks.Verdict{}, err
	}
	for _, f := range files {
		if f.Path == "README.md" {
			return checks.Pass("has a README.md"), nil
		}
	}
	return checks.Fail("needs a README.md"), nil
}

func main() {
	checks.Main[Branch](checks.Check{Name: "readme", Remote: credentials.Remote, Run: run})
}
```

`in.Repo` fetches the branch and its parent into the program's local
repository. A verdict with a `Fix` commit asks the framework to push it.
Both need `Remote: credentials.Remote`, which reads the repository's
Secret. A check makes a `Fix` commit with `in.CommitTree`, which also needs
`SigningKey: signing.Key` to [sign it](#sign-commits). `generate` grants a
program what its packages call, so a check that reads only the `GitBranch`,
such as `check-approval`, leaves both out, and its program can't read
Secrets.

### Sandboxed checks

The checks that read files run in their controller's process. A check that
runs the branch's code, such as `go test`, runs it in a Pod instead.
`check-gotest` declares one Pod for each head with `kube.Own`, and reports
`Running` until the Pod finishes:

- An init container fetches the head from the repository. It's the only
  container that gets the repository's credentials, as environment
  variables from the Secret.
- The test container runs `go test ./...` as user 65532 with no service
  account token, no privileges, a read-only root file system, and
  `GOPROXY=off`, so tests can't download modules.
- If fetching fails, the check starts a new Pod, up to three times.
- At most `-max-pods` test Pods, 10 by default, run at once across all
  namespaces. A branch that would start another reports `Running` and waits
  until one finishes.

kube deletes a Pod when the check stops declaring it: after the check records
the Pod's result, or when the branch moves to a new head. Owner references
delete the Pods with their `GitBranch`. Set `-runtime-class` to run the Pods
under a sandboxing runtime such as gVisor, and `-go-image`, `-git-image`,
`-timeout`, and `-goproxy` to change the rest.

Both of a test Pod's containers meet the `restricted`
[Pod Security Standard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/).
An admission policy keeps `check-gotest` to its own Pods, in namespaces that
opt in to test Pods and enforce the `restricted` standard. See
[Install](#install).

## Merge gates

`when` is a [CEL](https://cel.dev) expression. It has one variable,
`checks`, which maps each check that the policy lists to an object with
`passed` (bool), `state` (string), and `outputs` (map of strings). A check
without a result for the branch's current commits has state `Pending`. All of
CEL works, for example `int(checks.risk.outputs.lines) < 500` or
`checks.all(c, checks[c].passed)`. In CEL, `&&` and `||` give a result when
one side decides it, even if the other side is an error, such as a missing
output. Without `when`, every listed check must pass.

The repository controller compiles each `when` when it reads the
`GitRepository`, so a syntax error or a misspelled field, such as
`checks.gofmt.pased`, makes the `GitRepository` not `Ready` instead of
holding branches back later. Each evaluation can cost at most 100,000, which
stops an expression that loops over the checks many times.

## Sign commits

`check-base` and `check-gofmt` make commits: merges of a parent into a
branch, and formatting fixes. Landing makes none, because it fast-forwards
the parent to a commit that's already on the branch. To sign the checks'
commits, make an SSH key for signing only, put it in its own Secret in the
`GitRepository`'s namespace, and name the Secret in the `GitRepository`:

```sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -C git-k8s -f git-k8s-signing
kubectl create secret generic app-signing --type=kubernetes.io/ssh-auth \
  --from-file=ssh-privatekey=git-k8s-signing
```

```yaml
spec:
  url: https://git.example.com/app.git
  secretRef:
    name: app-creds
  signingKeyRef:
    name: app-signing       # ssh-privatekey key, for signing commits
```

The checks sign with git's SSH signature format, `gpg.format=ssh`. Git runs
`ssh-keygen` to sign, so the checks' image needs it, and the
`cgr.dev/chainguard/git` image that [Install](#install) uses has it. The key
must be unencrypted, in the OpenSSH format that `ssh-keygen` writes. Ed25519
and RSA signatures come out the same every time, so a check still makes the
same fix commit from the same inputs; ECDSA signatures don't. Without
`signingKeyRef`, the checks' commits aren't signed.

git-k8s doesn't support keyless signing with
[gitsign](https://github.com/sigstore/gitsign), which signs with a
short-lived certificate from Sigstore for an OIDC identity, such as a
service account token, instead of a long-lived key, because:

- GitHub doesn't show gitsign signatures as verified, so a rule that
  requires signed commits rejects them.
- The public Sigstore service accepts tokens only from OIDC issuers that it
  knows, such as GKE and EKS clusters. Other clusters, including the kind
  cluster that the end-to-end test uses, need Sigstore services of their
  own.
- Signatures from gitsign differ every time, as ECDSA signatures do, so
  each retry of a fix makes a different commit.

[Future work](future-work.md#sign-commits-with-gitsign) lists what
supporting it needs.

The key needs a Secret of its own, because the `secretRef` Secret holds the
credentials for the remote, and each test Pod's init container gets some of
its keys. A check reports an error instead of signing if `signingKeyRef`
names the `secretRef` Secret.

Only `check-base` and `check-gofmt` read the signing Secret, through the
`signing` package, which no other program links. They read it only to sign
a commit that their policy lets them push. Other programs don't read the
key, but some can:

- `generate` lets each program that reads `secretRef` Secrets get every
  Secret in the namespaces that it watches, which is every namespace unless
  you pass `-watch-namespace`. Those programs are the core `git-k8s`
  program, `check-base`, `check-gofmt`, and `check-risk`, so signing gives
  `check-base` and `check-gofmt` no new permissions.
- `check-gotest` doesn't give its test Pods the signing Secret, but it can
  create Pods in the namespaces that it watches, and a Pod can mount any
  Secret in its namespace.

For each commit, a check writes the key to a file with mode 0600 in a new
directory with mode 0700 under `/tmp`, passes git the file's path, and
removes the directory when the commit is done. `/tmp` is an `emptyDir`
volume on the node's disk that outlives the container, so a check that's
killed while it signs leaves the key there until the check restarts and
removes it, or until the Pod is deleted. The key never appears in a
command's arguments or environment, in a log, or in an error.

### Set up the forge

A forge shows a commit as verified when the key that signed it belongs to
the commit's committer. On GitHub:

1. As the account that git-k8s commits as, such as a bot account, go to
   **Settings** > **SSH and GPG keys** > **New SSH key**, set **Key type**
   to **Signing Key**, and add `git-k8s-signing.pub`. Or run
   `gh ssh-key add git-k8s-signing.pub --type signing` as that account.
2. Set the `-identity-email` flag of `check-base` and `check-gofmt` to an
   email address that the account has verified, such as its
   `ID+USERNAME@users.noreply.github.com` address. GitHub marks a commit
   **Verified** only when its committer email belongs to the account that
   has the key. To pass a flag, add it after `--` in the `generate`
   command, as in [Install](#install).

A GitHub App can't have a signing key. GitHub signs the commits that an App
makes through its API, but the checks make commits with git, so they sign
them with an account's key even when they push with an App's token. GitHub
verifies a signature no matter which credential pushed the commit.

### Protected branches

Checks push their commits to the branch that they check, and the merge
controller pushes the parent when a branch lands. GitHub's branch
protection rules and rulesets apply to those pushes:

- Rules that limit who can push to the parent, such as **Require a pull
  request before merging** and **Restrict updates**, reject a landing
  unless the account or GitHub App that git-k8s pushes as can bypass them.
  In a ruleset, add the account or App to the bypass list, set to **Always
  allow**. If the bypass list doesn't offer individual accounts, add a team
  whose only member is git-k8s's account. A bypass applies to every rule in
  its ruleset, so put the rules that git-k8s has to follow, such as
  **Require signed commits**, in another ruleset, without git-k8s in its
  bypass list. In a classic branch protection rule, add the account or App
  to **Allow specified actors to bypass required pull requests**, and to
  **Restrict who can push to matching branches** if that's on.
- **Require status checks to pass** rejects a landing unless the branch's
  head already passed those checks, for example in CI that runs on the
  branch. git-k8s doesn't report its own results to GitHub yet.
- **Require signed commits** refuses a landing unless GitHub verifies the
  signature of every commit that it adds to the parent, so people have to
  sign with a key on their GitHub account and use a committer email that
  the account has verified.
- **Require linear history** rejects the merge commits that `check-base`
  makes. Leave it off for a parent whose merge policy lets `base` push.
- **Block force pushes** doesn't affect git-k8s, which pushes only
  fast-forwards and deletions.
- **Restrict deletions** on a branch stops `deleteMergedBranches` from
  deleting it after it lands.

When GitHub refuses a check's commit or a landing, the reason that it gives
shows up on the `GitBranch`. For a check's commit, the check's result in
`status.checks` has state `Error` and the reason in its message. For a
landing, the `Synced` condition is `False` and has the reason in its
message. git-k8s retries refused pushes, waiting longer each time, up to
about 5 minutes.

## Install

Each program installs with kube's `generate` command, which builds an image,
pushes it, and writes the YAML for its namespace, service account, RBAC
rules, and Deployment. The programs run `git`, so build them on an image
that has it. They keep local copies of repositories in `/tmp/git-k8s`, on
the `emptyDir` volume that `generate` mounts at `/tmp`:

```sh
for program in git-k8s check-base check-gofmt check-risk check-approval check-gotest; do
  go run "./cmd/${program}" generate -registry=REGISTRY -base=cgr.dev/chainguard/git:latest | kubectl apply -f -
done
kubectl apply -f config/policy.yaml
```

Replace `REGISTRY` with a registry and repository prefix that your cluster
can pull from, such as `ghcr.io/you`. To pass flags to a program, add them
after `--`, as in `go run ./cmd/check-risk generate -registry=REGISTRY -- -sensitive='auth/**'`.

`config/policy.yaml` holds three ValidatingAdmissionPolicies. The first lets
the service account of `check-NAME` change only `status.checks.NAME`, and
stops every other service account, including the core program's, from
changing `status.checks`. A check must run as the service account
`check-NAME` in the namespace `check-NAME`, as `generate` installs it, to
write results. Server-side apply already keeps the controllers' writes
apart; the policy stops a buggy or compromised check from writing another
check's result. The second stops every git-k8s service account from setting
the approve annotation, which is for people, and stops checks from changing
`GitBranch` objects at all. RBAC also keeps every check except `check-gotest`,
which owns the Pods that run tests, from patching `GitBranch` objects.
`generate` grants that permission to a check that owns objects, because it
can't tell whether an owned object needs a finalizer on its owner. The second
policy denies the annotation that kube adds with that finalizer, so a check
can own only namespaced objects in the branch's namespace.

The third keeps each check to its own Pods. `generate` lets a check that
declares Pods with `kube.Own`, such as `check-gotest`, create, patch, and
delete Pods in every namespace, because RBAC can't limit those verbs to the
Pods that a program created. kube labels each Pod that `check-NAME` declares
with `kube.imjasonh.github.io/controller=check-NAME`. The policy lets the
check change or delete only Pods with that label, and its new Pods must have
it. A new Pod's name must be `NAME-ID`, where `ID` has no hyphens, so that a
check can't take the name of another check's next Pod and block it. The check
can't write Pods in the `git-k8s` or `check-*` namespaces. Elsewhere, it
creates and changes Pods only in namespaces that have the label
`git-k8s.imjasonh.com/check-pods=true` and enforce the `restricted` Pod
Security Standard at version `latest`. It can delete its Pods in a namespace
without those labels, so it can clean up after a namespace drops them. Its
Pods must run as their namespace's `default` service account, and a new Pod
can't set `spec.nodeName`.

The policy itself enforces the `baseline` Pod Security Standard, more strictly
for capabilities and sysctls. It denies these fields in containers, init
containers, and ephemeral containers:

- The node's network, PID, and IPC namespaces
- `hostPath` volumes and host ports
- Privileged containers and added capabilities
- An unmasked `/proc`, the `Unconfined` seccomp profile, and Windows host
  processes
- The `Unconfined` AppArmor profile, SELinux users and roles, SELinux types
  other than the container types that `baseline` allows, and sysctls
- Probes and lifecycle handlers that set `host`, which make the kubelet
  connect from the node to another address

Pod Security admission enforces the rest of `restricted`, such as running as
a non-root user. An exemption in the cluster's Pod Security admission
configuration that covers a check's Pods, by user, RuntimeClass, or
namespace, weakens only that rest. The policy doesn't limit node selectors,
affinity, tolerations, or `runtimeClassName`, so a compromised check can
schedule Pods onto any node, including tainted ones, and start them without
the RuntimeClass that `-runtime-class` sets. To require that RuntimeClass,
add a ValidatingAdmissionPolicy that denies a Pod with the label
`kube.imjasonh.github.io/controller=check-gotest` unless its
`spec.runtimeClassName` is the RuntimeClass.

The policy matches every service account whose namespace or name starts with
`check-`. Of those, only `check-NAME` in the namespace `check-NAME`, as
`generate` installs the `NAME` check, can write Pods. Any other, such as an
unrelated service account named `check-deployer`, can't write Pods at all. A
check that runs as another service account needs a policy of its own. If that
policy reads parameters, its binding must set
`parameterNotFoundAction: Allow`. The API server looks up a binding's
parameters before it evaluates the policy's match conditions, so with `Deny`,
every Pod write in the cluster fails while the parameters are missing.

In a namespace that opts in, a compromised check's Pods can still mount the
namespace's Secrets, ConfigMaps, and PersistentVolumeClaims, run as its
`default` service account, and mount tokens for that account with any
audience. A service that accepts those tokens must check which Pod a token is
bound to, and that the Pod has the label of the check that the service
trusts.

Without the policies, most of that doesn't hold, so the repositories
controller sets a `PoliciesInstalled` condition on each `GitRepository`. It's
`False` until all three policies are installed with bindings that deny.

Each namespace that holds a `GitRepository` whose merge policy lists `gotest`
must opt in to test Pods and enforce the `restricted` Pod Security Standard,
or the third policy denies the test Pods:

```sh
kubectl label namespace NAMESPACE git-k8s.imjasonh.com/check-pods=true pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=restricted
```

Replace `NAMESPACE` with the namespace of the `GitRepository`. The namespace
can't be `git-k8s` or start with `check-`. If it has the label
`pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version`, the label's value must be
`latest`. Until the namespace has both labels, the branch's `gotest` result
stays `Running`, and its message says why kube couldn't create the Pod. kube
tries again with backoff that grows to 5 minutes, plus up to 10% jitter, so it
creates the Pod within about 5.5 minutes after you label the namespace,
without a new push.

If `check-gotest` already runs, label the namespaces of its repositories
before you apply `config/policy.yaml`. Otherwise the policy denies their test
Pods until you do.

## Test

The unit tests call each reconciler with `kube.Fake` and a real git server
that runs in the test process:

```sh
go test -race ./...
```

The end-to-end test installs every program with `generate` in a
[kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster with a local registry. It runs a
git server on this machine, which Pods reach through the kind network's
gateway, and pushes branches to it. The git server accepts only commits
signed with their committer's key, as a forge that requires signed commits
does, so the test fails if git-k8s pushes an unsigned commit. It needs
Docker, `kubectl`, `git`, and `ssh-keygen`, and installs kind if it's
missing:

```sh
GIT_K8S_KIND_E2E=1 go test -v -count=1 ./e2e/kind/
```

CI runs it when `git-k8s/` or `kube/` changes. To keep the cluster
afterward, set `GIT_K8S_KIND_KEEP=1`. If your network can't reach `cgr.dev`,
set `GIT_K8S_KIND_CHAINGUARD=docker.io/chainguard`.

## Limitations

- The controllers poll remotes; they don't receive webhooks. A check's status
  write runs the repositories controller again, so a check's fix is listed
  soon after the check pushes it. The controller lists a repository at most
  once every 5 seconds, or every `pollInterval` if that's shorter.
- Remotes authenticate with HTTP basic auth only.
- `check-gotest` runs Pods in the `GitBranch`'s namespace and doesn't add a
  NetworkPolicy, so a test can reach anything that the namespace's Pods can.
