# git-k8s

git-k8s runs a branch workflow on Kubernetes. It tracks a remote git
repository's branches as `GitBranch` objects and runs checks on branches
that propose changes to another branch. Checks can push commits that fix
what they find. When the parent's merge policy passes, git-k8s lands the
branch on the parent by fast-forward, squash, or rebase.

It's a rewrite of [imjasonh/git-k8s](https://github.com/imjasonh/git-k8s)
on [`kube`](../kube/), the controller framework in this repository. The
module imports `kube` at head with `replace github.com/imjasonh/playground/kube => ../kube`.

## How it works

You write a `GitRepository`:

```yaml
apiVersion: git-k8s.imjasonh.com/v1alpha1
kind: GitRepository
metadata:
  name: app
spec:
  url: https://git.example.com/app.git
  secretRef:
    name: app-creds         # username and password keys, for HTTP basic auth
  pollInterval: 30s
  branches:
    - match: main
      merge:
        checks:
          - name: base
            mayPush: true
          - name: gofmt
            mayPush: true
          - name: risk
          - name: approval
        when: >-
          checks.base.passed && checks.gofmt.passed &&
          (checks.risk.outputs.level == "low" || checks.approval.passed)
        deleteMergedBranches: true
    - match: c/**
      parent: main
```

For each remote branch, the first rule whose `match` glob matches applies,
and branches that match no rule aren't tracked. A branch whose rule names a
`parent` is a proposal to that parent. The parent's rule says what a proposal
needs before it lands.

The `git-k8s` program runs two controllers, and each check runs as its own
program. Each controller is a `kube.For` reconciler:

- The **repositories** controller lists each repository's branches with
  `git ls-remote` and declares a `GitBranch` for each tracked branch with
  `kube.Own`. The spec holds the branch's head, its parent's head, and the
  parent's merge policy. When a branch disappears from the remote, kube
  deletes its `GitBranch`, because the reconcile stops declaring it. A remote
  can't be watched, so the controller asks to run again after `pollInterval`.
- Each **check** controller is its own program. It reconciles `GitBranch`
  objects through a view type that declares only the check's own entry in
  `status.checks`. kube writes the view's status with server-side apply, so
  each check manages one map key and never sees or rewrites another check's
  result. Results record the commits they're for, and the merge controller
  ignores results for older commits.
- The **merge** controller evaluates the merge policy's `when` expression
  over the fresh results. When it passes, the controller lands the branch,
  as [Landing methods](#landing-methods) describes, with
  `git push --force-with-lease`, so a parent that moved in the meantime is
  never overwritten. It then deletes the branch if the policy says to.

The checks and the merge controller read each branch's repository as a
`gitk8s.Repository`, a `GitRepository` without its status, so the
repositories controller's status writes don't run them again.

Git objects stay in local bare repositories, one for each `GitRepository`
in each program. Only commit SHAs go into Kubernetes objects, and no object
records a single push or check run, so the API server holds a bounded amount
of state.

After a branch lands, `kubectl get gitbranches` shows what's still open:

```
NAME                    BRANCH   HEAD                                       PARENT   STATE              AGE
app-c-auth-f684729ccf   c/auth   d28547a6c959905ea8dc037ac37541167a50638c   main     WaitingForChecks   9s
app-main-9157892a7c     main     610a7734a0b4d1bc1991a669d9feb35fd159219b                               48s
```

The `Merged` condition's message explains a `WaitingForChecks` state, for
example `checks: approval Failed, base Passed, gofmt Passed, risk Passed (high)`.

## Checks

| Program | Check | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `check-base` | `base` | Passes when the branch contains its parent's head, or the parent already contains the branch. Otherwise it merges the parent in with `git merge-tree`, and fails with the conflicting paths if the merge conflicts. |
| `check-gofmt` | `gofmt` | Formats every `.go` file outside `vendor` and `testdata` directories with `go/format`, and passes when nothing changes. |
| `check-risk` | `risk` | Always passes, and sets `outputs.level` to `high` when the change is larger than `-max-lines` or touches a path that matches a `-sensitive` glob, and to `low` otherwise. |
| `check-approval` | `approval` | Passes when the `git-k8s.imjasonh.com/approve` annotation on the `GitBranch` names the branch's head. A push after the approval needs a new one. |
| `check-gotest` | `gotest` | Runs `go test ./...` in a Pod that it declares with `kube.Own`, and fails with the end of the test output. See [Sandboxed checks](#sandboxed-checks). |

A check with `mayPush: true` pushes its fix commit to the branch, which moves
the head and runs the checks again. Fix commits have a `Git-K8s-Fixer:
CHECK` trailer, and `maxAutomatedCommits` (default 5) limits how many a
branch can have, so two checks that undo each other's fixes stop. The same
inputs always produce the same fix commit, so two retries of one fix push the
same commit.

To approve a branch:

```sh
kubectl annotate gitbranch GITBRANCH git-k8s.imjasonh.com/approve=SHA
```

### Write a check

A check is a `checks.Check` and a view type that names its key in
`status.checks`. This `main` package, next to the others in `cmd/`, is a
complete check that fails branches without a `README.md`:

```go
type Branch struct {
	kube.Object `kube:"apiVersion=git-k8s.imjasonh.com/v1alpha1,kind=GitBranch,plural=gitbranches,scope=Namespaced"`
	Spec        gitk8s.GitBranchSpec `json:"spec"`
	Status      struct {
		Checks struct {
			Result *gitk8s.CheckResult `json:"readme,omitempty"`
		} `json:"checks,omitzero"`
	} `json:"status,omitzero"`
}

func (b *Branch) Parts() (*kube.ObjectMeta, *gitk8s.GitBranchSpec, **gitk8s.CheckResult) {
	return &b.ObjectMeta, &b.Spec, &b.Status.Checks.Result
}

func run(ctx context.Context, in *checks.Input) (checks.Verdict, error) {
	repo, err := in.Repo(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		return checks.Verdict{}, err
	}
	files, err := repo.LsTree(ctx, in.Spec.Head)
	if err != nil {
		return checks.Verdict{}, err
	}
	for _, f := range files {
		if f.Path == "README.md" {
			return checks.Pass("has a README.md"), nil
		}
	}
	return checks.Fail("needs a README.md"), nil
}

func main() {
	checks.Main[Branch](checks.Check{Name: "readme", Remote: credentials.Remote, Run: run})
}
```

`in.Repo` fetches the branch and its parent into the program's local
repository. A verdict with a `Fix` commit asks the framework to push it.
Both need `Remote: credentials.Remote`, which reads the repository's
Secret. `generate` grants a program what its packages call, so a check that
reads only the `GitBranch`, such as `check-approval`, leaves `Remote` out,
and its program can't read Secrets.

Set `FilesOnly` in a check's `checks.Check` when its result for the branch's
head also holds for any commit with the same files that builds on the same
parent head, because the result doesn't depend on the branch's commits, such
as their messages or authors. Squash and rebase landings count only such
results for the commits that they make, as
[Which results count](#which-results-count) describes.

### Sandboxed checks

The checks that read files run in their controller's process. A check that
runs the branch's code, such as `go test`, runs it in a Pod instead.
`check-gotest` declares one Pod for each head with `kube.Own`, and reports
`Running` until the Pod finishes:

- An init container fetches the head from the repository. It's the only
  container that gets the repository's credentials, as environment
  variables from the Secret.
- The test container runs `go test ./...` as user 65532 with no service
  account token, no privileges, a read-only root file system, and
  `GOPROXY=off`, so tests can't download modules.
- If fetching fails, the check starts a new Pod, up to three times.
- At most `-max-pods` test Pods, 10 by default, run at once across all
  namespaces. A branch that would start another reports `Running` and waits
  until one finishes.

kube deletes a Pod when the check stops declaring it: after the check records
the Pod's result, or when the branch moves to a new head. Owner references
delete the Pods with their `GitBranch`. Set `-runtime-class` to run the Pods
under a sandboxing runtime such as gVisor, and `-go-image`, `-git-image`,
`-timeout`, and `-goproxy` to change the rest.

## Merge gates

`when` is a [CEL](https://cel.dev) expression. It has one variable,
`checks`, which maps each check that the policy lists to an object with
`passed` (bool), `state` (string), and `outputs` (map of strings). A check
without a result for the branch's current commits has state `Pending`. All of
CEL works, for example `int(checks.risk.outputs.lines) < 500` or
`checks.all(c, checks[c].passed)`. In CEL, `&&` and `||` give a result when
one side decides it, even if the other side is an error, such as a missing
output. Without `when`, every listed check must pass.

The repository controller compiles each `when` when it reads the
`GitRepository`, so a syntax error or a misspelled field, such as
`checks.gofmt.pased`, makes the `GitRepository` not `Ready` instead of
holding branches back later. Each evaluation can cost at most 100,000, which
stops an expression that loops over the checks many times.

## Landing methods

A merge policy's `landing` field sets how branches land on the branches that
its rule matches. For example, this rule squashes each branch that lands on
`main`:

```yaml
    - match: main
      merge:
        landing: Squash
```

- `FastForward`, the default, moves the parent to the branch's head, so the
  parent ends up at the commit that the checks saw.
- `Squash` makes one commit with the files at the branch's head, on top of
  the parent's head.
- `Rebase` copies each of the branch's commits onto the parent's head, in
  order, and leaves out merge commits.

Like a fast-forward, a squash or rebase lands only a branch that contains the
parent's head, such as one that `check-base` merged the parent into.

A squash keeps the author and message of the branch's only commit that isn't
a merge or a check's fix. When the branch has several such commits, the
message starts with the first one's subject and lists the subject of every
commit that isn't a merge. It ends with the trailers of the commits that
aren't fixes, such as `Signed-off-by`, and a `Co-authored-by` trailer for
each of their authors besides the first. The squashed message never has a
`Git-K8s-Fixer` trailer, so the commit doesn't count as a fix. A rebase keeps
each commit's author and message, and leaves out a commit that changes
nothing, such as a change that the parent already has.

The merge controller commits as
`git-k8s <git-k8s@users.noreply.github.com>`, which its `-identity-name` and
`-identity-email` flags change. It takes commit times from the commits that
it copies, so making the same landing again makes the same commits.

When the branch is one commit on top of the parent's head, a squash
fast-forwards the parent to it. A rebase does the same for a branch with no
merge commits after the parent's head, because copying its commits changes
nothing. When the parent already has the files at the branch's head, a squash
sets the branch's state to `Merged` and pushes nothing. A rebase does that
only when the parent already has every commit's change, because it leaves out
each commit that changes nothing.

A rebase can't copy every branch. It sets the branch's state to
`NeedsRebase`, with a message that says why, when one of these happens:

- Copying a commit conflicts. A branch whose merge commit resolved a
  conflict with the parent does this, because the rebase leaves the merge
  out.
- A merge commit in the branch makes changes of its own, so the copies don't
  end up with the files at the branch's head.
- A commit has no parent, such as the first commit of an unrelated history.

To land such a branch, rebase it yourself, or set `landing: Squash`.

### Which results count

Squash and rebase landings make commits that no check saw. A squashed commit
has the files at the branch's head, on top of the parent's head, and so does
the last commit of a rebase. Those are the files and the parent head that the
checks saw, so a check that reads only files gives the new commit the same
result. As with a fast-forward, no check sees a rebase's earlier commits.

Other results depend on more than the files, such as those of a check that
reads the commits' messages, authors, signatures, or trailers like
`Signed-off-by`, or that counts the branch's commits. An agent that reviews
commit messages as well as the change is another. So a result for the
branch's head counts for the new commit only when its check sets `FilesOnly`
in its `checks.Check`, which gives its results `filesOnly: true`. A check
without `FilesOnly` costs one more round of checks, as the end of this section
describes.

The built-in checks set `FilesOnly`. `check-base` passes for any commit that
builds on the parent's head, `check-gofmt` and `check-gotest` read only the
files, and `check-risk` compares them with the parent's head.
`check-approval` reads only the `GitBranch`, and an approval is for the
change, which the new commit makes too. `maxAutomatedCommits` counts fix
commits by their trailer, but it limits what checks push, and the gate
doesn't read it.

When the counted results pass the gate, the controller lands the new commit
without another round of checks. It pushes the commit to the parent, with a
lease on the parent's head. The same atomic push deletes the branch, with a
lease on its head, or moves the branch to the new commit when
`deleteMergedBranches` is off. A branch that stays is then at its parent's
head, so it shows `Merged` instead of commits that the parent doesn't have.
If the parent or the branch moved since the repositories controller listed
them, the push changes neither, and the controller tries again.

When the gate doesn't pass on the counted results alone, the controller
pushes the new commit to the branch instead, with a lease on the branch's
head, and sets the branch's state to `Rewritten`. The checks run on the new
commit, and when the gate passes, the parent fast-forwards to it.
`check-approval` passes only for the head that the annotation names, so a
rewritten branch needs a new approval.

A check with `mayPush: true` can push a fix on top of the new commit. While
the parent doesn't move, a squash landing doesn't squash its own commit and
the fixes after it again, so they land by fast-forward, with each fix as its
own commit. Another squash would keep the fixes' files but drop their
commits, so a check that reads commits could push the same fix forever.
`maxAutomatedCommits` counts only the fixes after the squashed commit,
because it doesn't have the trailers of the fixes before it.

Moving a branch that stays, and pushing a rewritten branch, replace the
branch's commits on the remote, so the remote must allow force pushes to
proposal branches. Before you push to a branch that the controller moved,
reset your copy to the remote's.

## Install

Each program installs with kube's `generate` command, which builds an image,
pushes it, and writes the YAML for its namespace, service account, RBAC
rules, and Deployment. The programs run `git`, so build them on an image
that has it. They keep local copies of repositories in `/tmp/git-k8s`, on
the `emptyDir` volume that `generate` mounts at `/tmp`:

```sh
for program in git-k8s check-base check-gofmt check-risk check-approval check-gotest; do
  go run "./cmd/${program}" generate -registry=REGISTRY -base=cgr.dev/chainguard/git:latest | kubectl apply -f -
done
kubectl apply -f config/policy.yaml
```

Replace `REGISTRY` with a registry and repository prefix that your cluster
can pull from, such as `ghcr.io/you`. To pass flags to a program, add them
after `--`, as in `go run ./cmd/check-risk generate -registry=REGISTRY -- -sensitive='auth/**'`.

`config/policy.yaml` holds two ValidatingAdmissionPolicies. The first lets
the service account of `check-NAME` change only `status.checks.NAME`, and
stops every other service account, including the core program's, from
changing `status.checks`. A check must run as the service account
`check-NAME` in the namespace `check-NAME`, as `generate` installs it, to
write results. Server-side apply already keeps the controllers' writes
apart; the policy stops a buggy or compromised check from writing another
check's result. The second stops every git-k8s service account from setting
the approve annotation, which is for people, and stops checks from changing
`GitBranch` objects at all.

Without the policies, none of that holds, so the repositories controller
sets a `PoliciesInstalled` condition on each `GitRepository`. It's `False`
until both policies are installed with bindings that deny.

## Test

The unit tests call each reconciler with `kube.Fake` and a real git server
that runs in the test process:

```sh
go test -race ./...
```

The end-to-end test installs every program with `generate` in a
[kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster with a local registry. It runs a
git server on this machine, which Pods reach through the kind network's
gateway, and pushes branches to it. It needs Docker, `kubectl`, and `git`,
and installs kind if it's missing:

```sh
GIT_K8S_KIND_E2E=1 go test -v -count=1 ./e2e/kind/
```

CI runs it when `git-k8s/` or `kube/` changes. To keep the cluster
afterward, set `GIT_K8S_KIND_KEEP=1`. If your network can't reach `cgr.dev`,
set `GIT_K8S_KIND_CHAINGUARD=docker.io/chainguard`.

## Limitations

- The controllers poll remotes; they don't receive webhooks. A check's status
  write runs the repositories controller again, so a check's fix is listed
  soon after the check pushes it. The controller lists a repository at most
  once every 5 seconds, or every `pollInterval` if that's shorter.
- Remotes authenticate with HTTP basic auth only.
- `check-gotest` runs Pods in the `GitBranch`'s namespace and doesn't add a
  NetworkPolicy, so a test can reach anything that the namespace's Pods can.
- Squash and rebase landings make unsigned commits, even from signed ones.
  With a check that requires signed commits, use `FastForward`.

[`future-work.md`](future-work.md) proposes fixes for these, and lists the
other known gaps.
