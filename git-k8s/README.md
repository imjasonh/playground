# git-k8s

git-k8s runs a branch workflow on Kubernetes. It tracks a remote git
repository's branches as `GitBranch` objects and runs checks on branches
that propose changes to another branch. Checks can push commits that fix
what they find. When the parent's merge policy passes, git-k8s fast-forwards
the parent to the branch.

It's a rewrite of [imjasonh/git-k8s](https://github.com/imjasonh/git-k8s)
on [`kube`](../kube/), the controller framework in this repository. The
module imports `kube` at head with `replace github.com/imjasonh/playground/kube => ../kube`.

## How it works

You write a `GitRepository`:

```yaml
apiVersion: git-k8s.imjasonh.com/v1alpha1
kind: GitRepository
metadata:
  name: app
spec:
  url: https://git.example.com/app.git
  secretRef:
    name: app-creds         # username and password keys, for HTTP basic auth
  pollInterval: 30s
  branches:
    - match: main
      merge:
        checks:
          - name: base
            mayPush: true
          - name: gofmt
            mayPush: true
          - name: risk
          - name: approval
        when: >-
          checks.base.passed && checks.gofmt.passed &&
          (checks.risk.outputs.level == "low" || checks.approval.passed)
        deleteMergedBranches: true
    - match: c/**
      parent: main
```

For each remote branch, the first rule whose `match` glob matches applies,
and branches that match no rule aren't tracked. A branch whose rule names a
`parent` is a proposal to that parent. The parent's rule says what a proposal
needs before it lands.

The `git-k8s` program runs two controllers, and each check runs as its own
program. Each controller is a `kube.For` reconciler:

- The **repositories** controller lists each repository's branches with
  `git ls-remote` and declares a `GitBranch` for each tracked branch with
  `kube.Own`. The spec holds the branch's head, its parent's head, and the
  parent's merge policy. When a branch disappears from the remote, kube
  deletes its `GitBranch`, because the reconcile stops declaring it. A remote
  can't be watched, so the controller asks to run again after `pollInterval`.
- Each **check** controller is its own program. It reconciles `GitBranch`
  objects through a view type that declares only the check's own entry in
  `status.checks`. kube writes the view's status with server-side apply, so
  each check manages one map key and never sees or rewrites another check's
  result. Results record the commits they're for, and the merge controller
  ignores results for older commits.
- The **merge** controller evaluates the merge policy's `when` expression
  over the fresh results. When it passes, the controller fast-forwards the
  parent with `git push --force-with-lease`, so a parent that moved in the
  meantime is never overwritten. It then deletes the branch if the policy
  says to.

The checks and the merge controller read each branch's repository as a
`gitk8s.Repository`, a `GitRepository` without its status, so the
repositories controller's status writes don't run them again.

Git objects stay in local bare repositories, one for each `GitRepository`
in each program. Only commit SHAs go into Kubernetes objects, and no object
records a single push or check run, so the API server holds a bounded amount
of state.

After a branch lands, `kubectl get gitbranches` shows what's still open:

```
NAME                    BRANCH   HEAD                                       PARENT   STATE              AGE
app-c-auth-f684729ccf   c/auth   d28547a6c959905ea8dc037ac37541167a50638c   main     WaitingForChecks   9s
app-main-9157892a7c     main     610a7734a0b4d1bc1991a669d9feb35fd159219b                               48s
```

The `Merged` condition's message explains a `WaitingForChecks` state, for
example `checks: approval Failed, base Passed, gofmt Passed, risk Passed (high)`.

## Checks

| Program | Check | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `check-base` | `base` | Passes when the branch contains its parent's head, or the parent already contains the branch. Otherwise it merges the parent in with `git merge-tree`, and fails with the conflicting paths if the merge conflicts. |
| `check-gofmt` | `gofmt` | Formats every `.go` file outside `vendor` and `testdata` directories with `go/format`, and passes when nothing changes. |
| `check-risk` | `risk` | Always passes, and sets `outputs.level` to `high` when the change is larger than `-max-lines` or touches a path that matches a `-sensitive` glob, and to `low` otherwise. |
| `check-approval` | `approval` | Passes when the `git-k8s.imjasonh.com/approve` annotation on the `GitBranch` names the branch's head. A push after the approval needs a new one. |
| `check-gotest` | `gotest` | Runs `go test ./...` in a Pod that it declares with `kube.Own`, and fails with the end of the test output. See [Sandboxed checks](#sandboxed-checks). |

A check with `mayPush: true` pushes its fix commit to the branch, which moves
the head and runs the checks again. Fix commits have a `Git-K8s-Fixer:
CHECK` trailer, and `maxAutomatedCommits` (default 5) limits how many a
branch can have, so two checks that undo each other's fixes stop. The same
inputs always produce the same fix commit, so two retries of one fix push the
same commit.

To approve a branch:

```sh
kubectl annotate gitbranch GITBRANCH git-k8s.imjasonh.com/approve=SHA
```

### Write a check

A check is a `checks.Check` and a view type that names its key in
`status.checks`. This `main` package, next to the others in `cmd/`, is a
complete check that fails branches without a `README.md`:

```go
type Branch struct {
	kube.Object `kube:"apiVersion=git-k8s.imjasonh.com/v1alpha1,kind=GitBranch,plural=gitbranches,scope=Namespaced"`
	Spec        gitk8s.GitBranchSpec `json:"spec"`
	Status      struct {
		Checks struct {
			Result *gitk8s.CheckResult `json:"readme,omitempty"`
		} `json:"checks,omitzero"`
	} `json:"status,omitzero"`
}

func (b *Branch) Parts() (*kube.ObjectMeta, *gitk8s.GitBranchSpec, **gitk8s.CheckResult) {
	return &b.ObjectMeta, &b.Spec, &b.Status.Checks.Result
}

func run(ctx context.Context, in *checks.Input) (checks.Verdict, error) {
	repo, err := in.Repo(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		return checks.Verdict{}, err
	}
	files, err := repo.LsTree(ctx, in.Spec.Head)
	if err != nil {
		return checks.Verdict{}, err
	}
	for _, f := range files {
		if f.Path == "README.md" {
			return checks.Pass("has a README.md"), nil
		}
	}
	return checks.Fail("needs a README.md"), nil
}

func main() { checks.Main[Branch](checks.Check{Name: "readme", Run: run}) }
```

`in.Repo` fetches the branch and its parent into the program's local
repository. A verdict with a `Fix` commit asks the framework to push it.

### Sandboxed checks

The checks that read files run in their controller's process. A check that
runs the branch's code, such as `go test`, runs it in a Pod instead.
`check-gotest` declares one Pod for each head with `kube.Own`, and reports
`Running` until the Pod finishes:

- An init container fetches the head from the repository. It's the only
  container that gets the repository's credentials, as environment
  variables from the Secret.
- The test container runs `go test ./...` as user 65532 with no service
  account token, no privileges, a read-only root file system, and
  `GOPROXY=off`, so tests can't download modules.
- If fetching fails, the check starts a new Pod, up to three times.

kube deletes a Pod when the check stops declaring it: after the check records
the Pod's result, or when the branch moves to a new head. Owner references
delete the Pods with their `GitBranch`. Set `-runtime-class` to run the Pods
under a sandboxing runtime such as gVisor, and `-go-image`, `-git-image`,
`-timeout`, and `-goproxy` to change the rest.

## Merge gates

`when` is a subset of [CEL](https://cel.dev). It has one variable, `checks`,
which maps each check that the policy lists to an object with `passed`
(bool), `state` (string), and `outputs` (map of strings). A check without a
result for the branch's current commits has state `Pending`. The language
has string literals, `true` and `false`, field selection, indexing with a
string (`checks["my-check"]`), `has()`, `==`, `!=`, `!`, `&&`, `||`, and
parentheses. As in CEL, `&&` and `||` give a result when one side decides it,
even if the other side is an error, such as a missing output. Without `when`,
every listed check must pass.

## Install

Each program installs with kube's `generate` command, which builds an image,
pushes it, and writes the YAML for its namespace, service account, RBAC
rules, and Deployment. The programs run `git`, so build them on an image
that has it. They keep local copies of repositories in `/tmp/git-k8s`, on
the `emptyDir` volume that `generate` mounts at `/tmp`:

```sh
for program in git-k8s check-base check-gofmt check-risk check-approval check-gotest; do
  go run "./cmd/${program}" generate -registry=REGISTRY -base=cgr.dev/chainguard/git:latest | kubectl apply -f -
done
kubectl apply -f config/policy.yaml
```

Replace `REGISTRY` with a registry and repository prefix that your cluster
can pull from, such as `ghcr.io/you`. To pass flags to a program, add them
after `--`, as in `go run ./cmd/check-risk generate -registry=REGISTRY -- -sensitive='auth/**'`.

`config/policy.yaml` holds two ValidatingAdmissionPolicies. The first lets
the service account of `check-NAME` change only `status.checks.NAME`, and
stops the core program from changing `status.checks`. Server-side apply
already keeps the controllers' writes apart; the policy stops a buggy or
compromised check from writing another check's result. The second stops
every git-k8s service account from setting the approve annotation, which is
for people, and stops checks from changing `GitBranch` objects at all.

## Test

The unit tests call each reconciler with `kube.Fake` and a real git server
that runs in the test process:

```sh
go test -race ./...
```

The end-to-end test installs every program with `generate` in a
[kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster with a local registry. It runs a
git server on this machine, which Pods reach through the kind network's
gateway, and pushes branches to it. It needs Docker, `kubectl`, and `git`,
and installs kind if it's missing:

```sh
GIT_K8S_KIND_E2E=1 go test -v -count=1 ./e2e/kind/
```

CI runs it when `git-k8s/` or `kube/` changes. To keep the cluster
afterward, set `GIT_K8S_KIND_KEEP=1`. If your network can't reach `cgr.dev`,
set `GIT_K8S_KIND_CHAINGUARD=docker.io/chainguard`.

## Limitations

- The controllers poll remotes; they don't receive webhooks. A check's status
  write runs the repositories controller again, so a check's fix is listed
  soon after the check pushes it.
- Remotes authenticate with HTTP basic auth only.
- `when` is a subset of CEL, not all of it.
- `check-gotest` runs Pods in the `GitBranch`'s namespace and doesn't add a
  NetworkPolicy, so a test can reach anything that the namespace's Pods can.
